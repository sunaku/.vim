#
# Lets you rename all *.get files in one fell swoop, from the comfort of Vim.
#
# Usage: bin/rename-editor
#
# The editor will present you with 3 split windows (left, middle, and right):
# 1. The left window lists the current names for your reference (read-only)
# 2. The middle window lists the current names for you to rename (writable)
# 3. The right window lists the default names for your reference (read-only)
#
# Edit the names in the middle window and then save the file before exiting.
# To cancel or avoid performing any renames, exit the editor without saving.
#
# Note: DO NOT change the order or amount of lines presented in the editor!

## gather current file names

listing=$(${0%/*}/locate "$@" | sort)

default=${0##*/}.default
current=${0##*/}.current
renames=${0##*/}.renames

test -s "$default" || echo "$listing" | while read -r get; do {

  url=$(cat "$get")
  name=$(basename "$url" .git)
  echo "${get%/*}/$name.get"

} </dev/null
done > "$default"
test -s "$current" || echo "$listing" > "$current"
test -s "$renames" || cp "$current" "$renames"

## let user rename the files

chmod -w "$current" "$default"
vimdiff "$current" "$renames" "$default" \
  -c 'execute "silent file ".expand("%")."//2"' \
  -c 'execute "normal! \<C-W>W"' \
  -c 'execute "silent file ".expand("%")."//3"' \
  -c 'execute "normal! \<C-W>W"'

## apply user's edited names

if test $(wc -l < "$current") -eq $(wc -l < "$renames"); then
  paste "$current" "$renames" | awk '$1 != $2' | while read -r old new; do
    ${0%/*}/rename-fromto "$old" "$new"
  done
fi

rm -f "$default" "$current" "$renames"
